## Getting started

1. Install [CraftJS](https://github.com/Ap3teus/craftjs)
2. Clone this repository into `js/plugins/` and rename `vk-ts` -> `vk`
3. Run `npm install` in the `js/plugins/vk` -folder
4. Run `npm start` to start the Typescript compiler
5. Run `/js refresh()` or (re)start your server
6. You're all set!

## Testing

Unit tests can be run by executing `/js runTests()` -command in the server. They are run using [Zora](https://github.com/lorenzofox3/zora) directly on the CraftJS Javascript-context.
